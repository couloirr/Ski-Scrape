Take a hard look at the Völkl Blaze 106 W Skis, a lightweight option that doesn't forget you sometimes need edgehold to get to and from those pow turns unscathed. Or mount the Blaze 106 with an alpine binding and revel in the nimble capabilities of a ski that knows more mass doesn't always equal more fun.

In the center of the core, a CNC-milled Isocore area contributes to optimal liveliness and dynamic development.

Each carbon strip is woven into the fibre glass to provide strength and stiffness in the full length of the ski.\n\n"},{"Sidewalls":"\n\nFull Strength Sidewall\n–\nThis construction places strips of protective material along the sides of each core, between the edge and the topsheet. Sidewalls provide the best possible edge hold and stability when the ski is engaged in a turn as well as protecting the wood core, edges and topsheet from impacts and outside damage.\n\n"},{"Edges":"\n\nXL 2.5mm Edges\n–\nExtra edge thickness gives the skier a pair of skis that absorb shock and impact much better than skis with standard edges. The result is a ski with a much higher life expectancy.\n\n"},{"Additional Features":"\n\nScratch Resistant Topsheet\n\n"},{"Binding Compatibility":"\n\nWe recommend a brake width equal to or at most 15 mm wider than the ski waist width.\n\n"}],"specs":[{"Terrain:":"Big Mountain, Powder, Alpine Touring"},{"Skis:":"No Bindings"},{"Ability Level:":"Advanced-Expert"},{"Rocker Type:":"Rocker/Camber/Rocker"},{"Turning Radius:":"Long"},{"Core/Laminates:":"Carbon, Wood"},{"Tail Type:":"Flat"},{"Warranty:":"2 Years"}],"size":["179","185"],"tableBody":[{"Tip Width (mm)":["141","141"]},{"Waist Width (mm)":["116","116"]},{"Tail Width (mm)":["131","131"]},{"Turning Radius (m)":["21","23"]},{"Indiv.
